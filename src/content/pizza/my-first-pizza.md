## The Beginning

Every pizza journey has to start somewhere. Mine started with a bag of 00 flour, way too much confidence, and a home oven that maxes out at 500°F.

## The Dough

I went with a classic Neapolitan recipe:

- 1000g Caputo 00 flour
- 650ml water (65% hydration)
- 3g active dry yeast
- 25g salt

Mixed it all together, did some stretch and folds, and let it cold ferment for 24 hours. The dough actually turned out pretty good - nice and airy with good gluten development.

## The Execution

Here's where things got interesting. Turns out, stretching pizza dough is harder than it looks. My first attempt looked more like a map of an undiscovered country than a circle.

> Pro tip: Let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before stretching. Cold dough fights back.

## The Bake

500°F on a pizza steel, 5 minutes total. The bottom got nice and crispy, but the top... let's just say leopard spotting requires temperatures my oven can only dream of.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Patience with the dough** - 24 hour cold ferment is worth it
2. **Room temp matters** - Cold dough = sad pizza
3. **Preheat longer** - Steel needs at least an hour at max temp
4. **Less is more** - Overloaded my first pizza with toppings

## Final Score

- Taste: 7/10
- Looks: 4/10
- Smoke detector triggers: 2

Not bad for a first attempt. The quest continues.
